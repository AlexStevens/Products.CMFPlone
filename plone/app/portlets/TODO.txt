plone.app.portlets to-do
========================

  Portlets

    o Make ClassicPortlet - must adequately wrap a legacy portlet macro
        - Look at Bling to determine what context must be provided
      
    o Make other portlets
        - Smart Folder renderer
        - News, Events (may be Smart Folder portlets)
      
        - Login
        - Calendar

  Plone Integration

    o Modify main_template to load portlets.leftcolumn and portlets.rightcolumn
    
    o Add dashboard page using portlets.dashboard
        - May need to split dashboard into several columns
        
    o Port portlet assignment UI from PlonePortlets
        - Assign portlets to context
        - Assign portlets to users, groups
  
    o Add a generic migration from left_slots/right_slots
        - Should be "on-demand" (perhaps automatic for site root)

  GenericSetup import/export handlers

    o Better test coverage for portlet manager GenericSetup import/export
        - export
        - re-import with purge
        - re-import without purge
      
    o Extend import/export handler to cover portlet assignments
        - requires individual import/export adapters for each portlet 
            assignment type!
