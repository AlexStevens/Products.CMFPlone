plone.app.portlets to-do
========================

  Tests
  
    - Existing tests do not work - they need to be updated for the latest
      refactoring. This will be fixed ASAP. :)
  
    Also test:
  
    - login portlet
    - add views
    - namespace traversal adapters

  Infrastructure
  
    o Need a custom permission for assign-personal-portlets, assign-group-
      portlets and so on!
      
    o Add form always redirects to @@manage-portlets (since HTTP_REFERER isn't
        useful)
  
    o Category mappings are created on-the-fly in the namespace traversal
      adapters, which many not be ideal (even though these are protected by
      ManagePortal)
      
        - may be sufficient to create when the management views are invoked
  
    o Portlets like the login portlet have no configuration: formlib then
        displays a blank page :-(
        - can we short-circuit these?
  
  Portlets

    o Make standard set of portlets
        - Smart Folder renderer
        - Document renderer
        - News
        - Events
        - Recent
        - Related
        - Calendar

  User Interface

    o Add dashboard page using portlets.dashboard
        - May need to split dashboard into several columns
        
    o Need UI for assigning user-, group- and content-type-portlets.
        - This should be very similar to how contextual portlets work
        - The IManagePortletsView could have a form field selecting which
          user/group/content type to manage, and when reloaded, the columns
          would change - problem is carrying that state across portlet changes.
        
    o There is no UI yet for blacklisting (stop-acquistion) of context, user,
      group or content-type portlets

  Plone Integration

    o Remove/deprecate portlets_fetcher
    
        - The need for a provider: expression will break existing customisations
          of main_template. May be better to put this expression in 
          portlet_fetcher.pt for now.
          
        - Consider what to do with 'sr', 'sl', 'hide_columns' and 
           'slots_mapping' in global_defines. Is anyone depending on these?
           
        - Need a way to signal that columns should be hidden
            - e.g. a property 'available' in the renderer?
          
    o Add migration steps to Plone's migration machinery
    
    o Set up default portlets during site set-up

  GenericSetup import/export handlers

    o Better test coverage for portlet manager GenericSetup import/export
        - export
        - re-import with purge
        - re-import without purge
      
    o Extend import/export handler to cover portlet assignments?
