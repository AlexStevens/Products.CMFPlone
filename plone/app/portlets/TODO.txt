plone.app.portlets to-do
========================

  Tests
  
    - manage assignments views (@@move-portlet-up etc)

  Bugs
  
    o Edit forms stopped working e.g.:
    
        """
        Unauthorized: The container has no security assertions.  Access to 
        'use_macro' of (ClassicPortletRenderer ...) denied.
        """

    o Add and edit forms always redirect to @@manage-portlets, even when you
      are viewing e.g. @@manage-content-type-portlets
        - HTTP_REFERER is not useful (referer is add/edit view...)
        - need to place a hidden form field or similar in the form - how (?)
        - refer to this in nextUrl() in formhelper.py
  
    o Portlets like the login portlet have no configuration: formlib then
        displays a blank page :-(
        - can we short-circuit these?
  
  Decisions
  
    o Category mappings are created on-the-fly in the namespace traversal
      adapters, which many not be ideal (even though these are protected by
      ManagePortal)
      
        - may be sufficient to create when the management views are invoked

  Portlets

    o Make standard set of portlets
        - Smart Folder renderer
        - Document renderer
        - News
        - Events
        - Recent
        - Related
        - Calendar

  User Interface

    o Add dashboard page using portlets.dashboard
        - May need to split dashboard into several columns
        - Need appropriate edit view

  Plone Integration

    o Remove/deprecate portlets_fetcher
    
        - The need for a provider: expression will break existing customisations
          of main_template. May be better to put this expression in 
          portlet_fetcher.pt for now.
          
        - Consider what to do with 'sr', 'sl', 'hide_columns' and 
           'slots_mapping' in global_defines. Is anyone depending on these?
           
        - Need a way to signal that columns should be hidden
            - e.g. a property 'available' in the renderer?
          
    o Add migration steps to Plone's migration machinery
    
    o Set up default portlets during site set-up

  GenericSetup import/export handlers

    o Better test coverage for portlet manager GenericSetup import/export
        - export
        - re-import with purge
        - re-import without purge
      
    o Extend import/export handler to cover portlet assignments?
